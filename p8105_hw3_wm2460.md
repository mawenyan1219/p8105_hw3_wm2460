## Problem 1

## Problem 2

### Step 1: Tidy the dataset

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("./accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_prefix = "activity_", 
    names_to = "minute", 
    values_to = "activity") %>% 
  mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute), 
         day_of_week = recode(day,"Monday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Tuesday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Wednesday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Thursday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Friday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Saturday" = "Weekend", 
                                   "Sunday" = "Weekend"))
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

#### Describe the dataset

In the `accel_df` dataset, there are 50400 observations and 6 variables.
The variables in this dataset include week, day_id, day, minute,
activity, day_of_week.

### Step 2: Traditional analyses of accelerometer data

``` r
traditional = accel_df %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(activity_sum = sum(activity)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Total activity for each day")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

#### Trend

The trend is apparent. The total activity across Monday to Friday is
more than the total activity done during the weeekend.

### Step 3: Single-panel plot

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute/60, y = activity, color = day)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day",
       x = "Hour",
       y = "Activity measured by accelerometer") +
  theme_bw()
```

#### Patterns

From the plot above, we can see that from hour 0 to hour 5, there were
usually not a lot of activity detected by the accelerometer. Between
hour 6 and hour 19, there are some more activity than the earlier hours.
However, most intense activity patterns usually happen between hour 19
and hour 22. This pattern is quite consistent across all 7 days of the
week.

## Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

### Exploration of this dataset

In the original `ny_noaa` dataset, there are 2595176 observations and 7
variables. The variables in this dataset include id, date, prcp, snow,
snwd, tmax, tmin.

There are a lot of observations with missing values in this dataset. For
the variable `prcp`, there are 145838 missing values. For the variable
`snow`, there are 381221 missing values. For the variable `snwd`, there
are 591786 missing values. For the variable `tmax`, there are 1134358
missing values. For the variable `tmin`, there are 1134420 missing
values.

### Step 1: Data cleaning

``` r
noaa_new = ny_noaa %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax), 
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
         tmin = tmin / 10,
         tmax = tmax / 10) %>% 
  filter(prcp >= "0", snow >= "0", snwd >= "0")

names(sort(-table(noaa_new$snow)))[1]
```

    ## [1] "0"

#### For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?

For snowfall, the most commonly observed values are 0. Because it is
more common for most stations to detect 0 snow.

### Step 2: Two-panel plot for average max temp

``` r
plot = noaa_new %>% 
  filter(month %in% c("1", "7")) %>% 
  group_by(year, month, id) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'month'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(. ~ month) +
    labs(title = 
           "Average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average max temperature") 
```

    ## Warning: Removed 4275 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

#### Is there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers?

In my opinion, it is clear that the average max temperature in January
is much lower than the average max temperature in July. There were some
outliers for both months, especially for January.

### Step 3: Plots for tmin vs tmax and snowfall

#### Plot for tmin vs tmax

``` r
vs_p = 
  noaa_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 

vs_p
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## Warning: Removed 731942 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

![](p8105_hw3_wm2460_files/figure-gfm/tmin_tmax-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Plot for snowfall

``` r
snowfall_p = 
  noaa_new %>% 
  filter(snow %in% (0:100)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
  
snowfall_p
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_wm2460_files/figure-gfm/snowfall-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Making the plots into a two-panel plot

``` r
(vs_p + snowfall_p)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## Warning: Removed 731942 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'
