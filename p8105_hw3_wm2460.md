## Problem 1

### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_wm2460_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

### Step 1: Tidy the dataset

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("./accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_prefix = "activity_", 
    names_to = "minute", 
    values_to = "activity") %>% 
  mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute), 
         day_of_week = recode(day,"Monday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Tuesday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Wednesday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Thursday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Friday" = "Weekday", 
                                   "Saturday" = "Weekend", 
                                   "Sunday" = "Weekend"))
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

#### Describe the dataset

In the `accel_df` dataset, there are 50400 observations and 6 variables.
The variables in this dataset include week, day_id, day, minute,
activity, day_of_week.

### Step 2: Traditional analyses of accelerometer data

``` r
traditional = accel_df %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(activity_sum = sum(activity)) %>% 
  arrange(week, (activity_sum)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = day,
              values_from = activity_sum) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
traditional
```

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Saturday |   Friday | Sunday |
|-----:|----------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|
|    1 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 |   376254 | 480542.6 | 631105 |
|    2 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 |   607175 | 568839.0 | 422018 |
|    3 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 |   382928 | 467420.0 | 467052 |
|    4 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 |     1440 | 154049.0 | 260617 |
|    5 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 |     1440 | 620860.0 | 138421 |

#### Trend

The trend is apparent. The total activity across Monday to Friday is
more than the total activity done during the weeekend.

### Step 3: Single-panel plot

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute/60, y = activity, color = day)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day",
       x = "Hour",
       y = "Activity measured by accelerometer") +
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_wm2460_files/figure-gfm/single_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

#### Patterns

From the plot above, we can see that from hour 0 to hour 5, there were
usually not a lot of activity detected by the accelerometer. Between
hour 6 and hour 19, there are some more activity than the earlier hours.
However, most intense activity patterns usually happen between hour 19
and hour 22. This pattern is quite consistent across all 7 days of the
week.

## Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

### Exploration of this dataset

In the original `ny_noaa` dataset, there are 2595176 observations and 7
variables. The variables in this dataset include id, date, prcp, snow,
snwd, tmax, tmin.

There are a lot of observations with missing values in this dataset. For
the variable `prcp`, there are 145838 missing values. For the variable
`snow`, there are 381221 missing values. For the variable `snwd`, there
are 591786 missing values. For the variable `tmax`, there are 1134358
missing values. For the variable `tmin`, there are 1134420 missing
values.

### Step 1: Data cleaning

``` r
noaa_new = ny_noaa %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax), 
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
         tmin = tmin / 10,
         tmax = tmax / 10,
         prcp = prcp / 10) 
```

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  count(snow) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    NA  381221
    ##  3    25   31022
    ##  4    13   23095
    ##  5    51   18274
    ##  6    76   10173
    ##  7     8    9962
    ##  8     5    9748
    ##  9    38    9197
    ## 10     3    8790
    ## # … with 272 more rows

#### For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?

For snowfall, the most commonly observed values is 0. Because it did not
snow most days in New York state during the given timeframe. The second
most observed value is `NA`, which means the value is missing.

As a note, I believe that mm is an appropriate unit for the `snow`
variable, therefore I will use the original variable to proceed.

### Step 2: Two-panel plot for average max temp

``` r
avg_max = noaa_new %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  filter(month %in% c("1", "7")) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
    geom_line(alpha = 0.25) + 
    facet_grid(. ~ month) +
    labs(title = 
           "Average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average max temperature") 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
avg_max
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_wm2460_files/figure-gfm/plot-1.png" width="90%" />

#### Is there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers?

In my opinion, it is clear that the average max temperature in January
is much lower than the average max temperature in July. There were some
outliers for both months, especially for January. Also, there is one
outlier for July as well.

### Step 3: Plots for tmin vs tmax and snowfall

#### Plot for tmin vs tmax

``` r
vs_p = 
  noaa_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_hex() +
  labs(title = "Tmin vs Tmax") 

vs_p
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_wm2460_files/figure-gfm/tmin_tmax-1.png" width="90%" />

#### Plot for snowfall

``` r
snowfall_p = 
  noaa_new %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(snow %in% (0:100)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of snowfall values by year", 
       x = "Snowfall in mm",
       y = "Year") 
  
snowfall_p
```
